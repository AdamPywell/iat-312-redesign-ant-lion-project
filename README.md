# README - Ant Lion Redesign (Unity Remaster)

## Project Overview
**Ant Lion Redesign** is a complete Unity rebuild of an old 2000's class game project from IAT 312. This version represents a radical transformation from the original, featuring:

- Completely new genre and gameplay mechanics
- Modern Unity-based architecture
- Redesigned graphics and sound assets
- Fresh gameplay experience while maintaining the core "Ant Lion" theme

## Installation & Play Instructions
1. Download all repository files into a single folder
2. Ensure all files remain together (do not separate the .exe from supporting files)
3. Double-click `AntLion Remastered.exe` to launch the game

## System Requirements
- Windows OS (tested on Windows 10/11)
- DirectX 11 compatible GPU
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 500MB disk space

## Development Details
- **Engine**: Unity
- **Project Type**: IAT 312 Group Class Project
